# Philip GeLinas — Software Engineer II

Full-stack software engineer focused on building scalable, cloud-based applications with clean architecture, modern tooling, and production-ready practices.

I enjoy working across the stack — from responsive, accessible front-end interfaces to reliable back-end services — with a strong emphasis on maintainability, testing, and real-world performance.
